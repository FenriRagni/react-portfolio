## Usage
Allows prospective employers to view a front-end only website that I developed with React and be able to see some of my work.

Main Page has an about me section <br>

Projects page that shows some of the work I've done <br>

Contact page is a non-functional representation of using React to allow for filling out of a form, the footer on every page has links to Github, email, and LinkedIn
